This plugin adds Clarity tracker to each of your wordpress pages. 
Clarity is a user behavior analytics tool that helps you understand how users are interacting with your website through features such as session replays and heatmaps.

== Description ==

Clarity is a behavioral analytics library written in javascript. It helps you understand how users view and use your website across all modern devices and browsers. Understanding how users navigate, interact and browse your website can provide new insights about your users. Empathizing with your users and seeing where features fail or succeed can help improve your product, grow revenue and improve user retention.

Clarity provides you all these insights by:
* Observing content layout, viewport, and user's interactions with the page
* Inspecting network requests on the page
* Logging the event stream in JSON format to a configurable endpoint
